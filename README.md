# SAS Sample Code

Some SAS code I have written

# Contents:

## listdirtodb.sas
List filenames in a folder into a data set. Works in SAS studio for those without access to PIPE.

## varupbound.sas
Computes the upper bound of a confidence interval of the estimated variance. Designed for one way ANOVA problems.

It is a work in progress..
