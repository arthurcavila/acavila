# SAS Sample Code

Some SAS code I have written

# Contents:

## listdirtodb.sas
List filenames in a folder into a data set. Works in SAS studio for those without access to PIPE.

## varupbound.sas
Computes the upper bound of a confidence interval of the estimated variance. Designed for one way ANOVA problems.

## Sample SAS code with PROC SQL and Macro code
Recursive elimination of variables from a regression model with high Variance Inflation Factors to eliminate multi-collinearity

## srqq.sas
Macro to plot Studentized Residuals on a QQ Plot with 95% confidence bands. Visual aid to identify the Normality assumption.

It is a work in progress..
